\chapter{Research Methodology}



A structured questionnaire was sent by email to various stakeholders in the DNS ecosystem. This method was chosen because of its convenience, compliance with participants' busy schedules, and permission for detailed responses at the respondents' will. The approach provided a means of soliciting a wide range of expert observations on DNS abuse in terms of definition, the most prevalent types, mitigation challenges, and the theme of transparency. 



\section{Questionnaire Design and Distribution} 

The questionnaire had to take into account all of these issues in a multidimensional approach, giving great emphasis, but not limited, to address the nature of DNS abuse mitigation transparency.

The questions were specifically designed to extract in-depth information about:


 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The definition of DNS abuse. 
  \item The types of DNS abuse stakeholders most commonly encounter, aiming to identify prevalent patterns and specific concerns within the ecosystem.
  
  \item The challenges and limitations faced in mitigating DNS abuse, seeking to understand the barriers to effective action.
  
  \item The mitigation strategies used, gathering information on the practical steps taken and their perceived effectiveness.
  
  \item The practice of publishing reports or data as a form of transparency, exploring the current state of openness in the field.
  
  \item The role of transparency in aiding or impeding DNS abuse mitigation efforts, probing the potential impacts of increased visibility.
  
  \item  The effects of transparency on the relationships between various DNS stakeholders, considering the broader implications for cooperation and trust.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Stakeholder Responses} 

The insights from the completed questionnaire of the different stakeholders reflect several key themes and insights critical to understanding DNS abuse, as well as the mitigation of this abuse. These include various perspectives on what exactly the definition of DNS abuse is, the types of abuse most observed, and the difficulties experienced by stakeholders in efforts to mitigate its abuse. Additional discussions are related to mitigation methods, which provide a full view of current practices and potential areas for improvement with respect to the DNS ecosystem.

Key themes and insights :

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Varied Definitions of DNS Abuse:} Although stakeholders largely accepted the definition that had been adopted by the ICANN Contract Parties, they also noted its shortcomings, especially in being too categorical and thus may leave out evolving types of abuse. It was considered that a more flexible way forward would be a robust framework to define the abuses to be mitigated at the domain name level.
  
  \item \textbf{Common Types of DNS Abuse:} They pointed out that phishing was the most common attack type, followed by malware, botnets, and spam. It was also pointed out that one of the most common problems was related to the challenge related to proving the number of spam-related domains.
  
  \item \textbf{Challenges in Mitigation:} Perhaps the most significant was the economic structure of the domain registration industry, its ability to mitigate malicious registrations without fundamentally altering it. Stakeholders clearly state that a significant difference between large registrars, generally considered good actors on the Internet, and smaller registrars with a higher level of DNS abuse underscores the different aspects of this problem within different industry segments.
  
  \item \textbf{Mitigation Strategies:} The responses included different strategies, such as blocking orders from some regions or using software to monitor abusive activities. Recommendations were made on the role of education and outreach, including relevant projects such as NetBeacon and Compass to report abuse and information on DNS abuse.
  
  \item \textbf{Role of Transparency:} Opinions on transparency were mixed since part of the respondents consider this positively because it is a tool that provides evidence to the industry in its fight against abuse, part of them consider it negatively as sensitive mitigation ways could be revealed. The impact of transparency was also elaborated on developments in relationships between all stakeholders, and there is in general agreement that transparency will increase understanding and teamwork through better communication on measures set against abuse.
  
\end{itemize}

The responses of the stakeholders significantly enriched the research by providing a detailed look at the practical challenges and strategies to mitigate DNS abuse. The responses not only offered valuable real-world perspectives, but also highlighted the importance of adaptive definitions, comprehensive mitigation strategies, and thoughtful consideration of transparency's role in the ecosystem. This analysis bridges theoretical knowledge with the experiences of those actively involved in mitigating DNS abuse.

\section{Types of DNS Abuse Encountered} 

The stakeholder responses provided details of the most prevalent forms of DNS abuse that were being encountered within their specific ecosystem. These insights reveal a view of the various types of abuse, each of which poses unique challenges that require tailored mitigation strategies.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Phishing: Stakeholders identified it as the most prevalent form of DNS abuse and the most visible. In fact, the total number of phishing incidents observed through tools such as NetBeacon and tracked by Compass is a stark and singular metric of just how big and urgent the problem has become in the wider DNS domain.
    \item Malware and Botnets: These also included malware and botnets, i.e. multifaceted DNS abuses. Such abuses not only compromise the integrity of systems but also present a security hazard to users and infrastructures in general.
    \item Spam: It is now recognised as widespread, and stakeholders have pointed out the challenges of quantifying and appropriately addressing the relevant spam-related domains. Therefore, it makes spam elusive for existing mitigation efforts that raise the bar with respect to the pursuit of next-generation detection and response mechanisms.
    \item Compromised CMS : Encounters with compromised content management systems (CMSs) have been referred to as common encounters. Consequently, such attacks are possible in cases of some other existing vulnerabilities in web platforms. This kind of abuse reinforces the need for strong web security control practices and the need for vigilance among platform operators.
    \item "Water Torture" Attacks: Known as random subdomain attacks, they represent a more technical and sophisticated form of DNS abuse. These attacks not only disrupt normal DNS operations but also require advanced countermeasures to effectively mitigate their impact.
\end{enumerate}

The varied nature of DNS abuse that stakeholders encounter underscores the fact that community efforts must continue to build on ongoing collaboration, innovation, and education to address these challenges effectively. This is derived from the experiences of stakeholders and forms a basis of paramount importance on which effective strategies and policies will be formulated in the mitigation of DNS abuse.

\section{Challenges in Mitigation and Mitigation Strategies} 

The responses of stakeholders demonstrated details of the multifaceted challenges in mitigating DNS abuse, coupled with the various strategies used to address these issues.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Economic and Technical Hurdles: A significant barrier identified was the economic structure of the DNS industry, characterised by low margins and high volumes, often limiting the resources available for robust mitigation efforts against DNS abuse. Stakeholders highlighted that about 80\% of malicious domain registrations could be traced back to a mix of large, well-known registrars and smaller entities with disproportionately high levels of abuse. This economic reality complicates the implementation of effective mitigation strategies, underscoring the need for innovative solutions that are both cost-effective and scalable.
    
    \item Regulatory Gaps: The regulatory environment was also cited as a challenge, including poor, weak, or absent policies and enforcement mechanisms that could not effectively handle DNS abuse effectively. Stakeholders pointed out the necessity for clearer regulations and standards that can guide the industry's anti-abuse efforts more effectively.
    \item Mitigation Strategies: Stakeholders have responded to this with a variety of mitigation strategies. They placed an emphasis on components of education, collaboration, and outreach to raise awareness and develop a social response to DNS abuse. Technological solutions such as abuse reporting intermediaries (NetBeacon) and measurement projects (Compass) that measure the Internet are vital in finding, reporting, and understanding abuse cases. Designed to improve reporting and mitigation, these tools can also capture essential data with a character that helps inform policy and regulatory responses.
    
    
\end{enumerate}


\section{Transparency in DNS Abuse Mitigation} 

The responses of stakeholders underscore the subtle perspective on transparency within the DNS abuse mitigation framework, highlighting both its potential benefits and challenges.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Benefits of Transparency: Increased transparency is widely recognised as a way to demonstrate commitment in the industry to defend against DNS abuse. It will encourage normalisation of mitigation efforts throughout the ecosystem, which means that proactive activity becomes more commonly adopted and attributed to a culture of responsibility and accountability. Transparency in reporting abuse metrics and mitigation outcomes can also enhance trust between users, regulators, and within the industry itself, promoting a unified approach to addressing DNS abuse. In addition, transparency is seen as a contributing element in improving understanding and cooperation among various entities involved in the DNS, including operators, registrars, registries, and regulators. By sharing information on abuse trends and mitigation strategies, stakeholders can better appreciate each other's challenges and contributions, leading to more effective collaborative efforts.

    \item Challenges and Concerns: Stakeholders raised several concerns about the degree and manner of transparency. One point of concern is that some sensitive mitigation strategies could be exposed that, in turn, could serve as a support for malicious actors, allowing them to discover ways to detect and mitigate abuse. This fine balance between providing useful information and protecting operational integrity is a significant challenge for many in the industry. Furthermore, there is apprehension that increased transparency might lead to regulatory or legal consequences, especially if disclosures are mandated in a manner that does not consider the practical aspects of abuse mitigation. The stakeholders also mentioned operational challenges, such as the capacity to complete transparency reporting, given the current reliance on less formal mechanisms for reporting abuse and monitoring mitigation.
    
    \item Strategic Approach to Transparency: Stakeholders advocate for a strategic approach to transparency that supports the goals of mitigation of DNS abuse without compromising the effectiveness of these efforts. This includes targeted transparency that focuses on aggregate data and trends rather than detailed disclosures of specific mitigation actions or techniques. Additionally, fostering an environment where sharing information does not lead to punitive outcomes, but rather supports collaborative improvement, is considered essential. Although the value of transparency for the mitigation of DNS abuse is considered high, stakeholders cautiously advocate that every step be done with care with regard to what, how, and to whom it shall be disclosed. A balanced approach that improves the collective ability to address DNS abuse while safeguarding the methods used is crucial for the ongoing evolution of transparency practices in the industry.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Impact on Relationships within the DNS Ecosystem} 

 Stakeholders pointed to a clearer potential impact on meaningful relationship building within their particular DNS ecosystems: greater transparency and mitigation. Better transparency is seen by creating a better understanding among different parties, for instance, among registries, registrars, and regulators about challenges and works against abuse, hence their collaboration and trust that improves combined efforts against abuse. However, this provision raises concerns that such transparency could get to the point of obstructing informal cooperation in general or actually reveal sensitive techniques from an operational standpoint detrimental to entities working together. Balance is a key element to ensure that these issues are addressed and that partners work harmoniously with each other within the DNS community.

In analysing the data from the stakeholder responses, a thorough examination of DNS abuse has been carried out. The stakeholders, deeply embedded in the DNS ecosystem, provide valuable information on the definitions and manifestations of DNS abuse. They highlight phishing as the most common and worrying type, with compromised CMS and confusable domains also noted for their prevalence. Challenges in mitigation are primarily related to economic factors and regulatory gaps, where the structure of the industry alters mitigation abuse actions and the lack of clear regulations muddy the waters. Mitigation strategies like targeted blocking and collaborative education are in play, though their implementation faces hurdles due to the industry's focus on throughput and the capacities of various entities. 
The role of transparency is acknowledged as double-edged; although it could foster accountability and trust, there is a risk that bad actors exploit sensitive techniques. Stakeholder experiences and strategies contribute to a deeper understanding of DNS abuse, suggesting the need for a multifaceted approach that involves adaptation, collaboration, and a careful balance of transparency.
