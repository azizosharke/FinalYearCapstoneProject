\chapter*{Abstract}

This research project explores the subject of DNS (Domain Name System) abuse, which is widespread and jeopardises the reliability and security of the Internet. The integrity of DNS operations has always been critical due to the growing reliance on the Internet for both personal and professional activity. To promote a safer online environment, this project investigates whether and if so, additional transparency related to DNS abuse mitigations might help improve the overall DNS ecosystem. Every type of abuse puts users at risk by making identity theft, money loss, data breaches, and system intrusions easier, as well as by undermining confidence in online services. The reseach project emphasises how urgent it is to address these problems because new technologies like IoT and AI have the potential to make them worse.

The methodology used in this study included a thorough examination of the DNS ecosystem, vulnerability identification, and an assessment of mitigation initiatives that are currently being implemented by important parties, such as registries and registrars. The survey of DNS infrastructure providers and stakeholders was part of the selective survey to determine the existing level of transparency in the mitigation of DNS abuse. This involved assessing the usefulness of transparency reports and how well they work to stop DNS abuse.Key findings point to a serious weakness in DNS abuse mitigation initiatives' openness. Although several organisations have taken positive steps towards transparency, there is still a lack of standardisation and fragmentation in the industry as a whole. The report makes a number of suggestions to improve openness and transparency, such as creating uniform reporting guidelines, encouraging greater cooperation between DNS stakeholders, and implementing best practices to deal with DNS abuse in an open and transparent manner.

This research project adds to the current conversation on DNS abuse by providing a practical reform plan and a detailed grasp of its complexities. It establishes the foundation for more successful mitigation of DNS abuse by promoting transparency, which hopefully will result in more secure and reliable Internet.

\section*{\Huge\textcolor{tcd_blue}{Acknowledgements}}

In the name of God, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.

First, I would like to thank God. Everything I do is only done with his permission. I sincerely thank everyone who helped me along the way with this thesis. First, I express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Stephen Farrell, my supervisor, whose knowledge, compassion, and tolerance greatly enhanced my graduate experience. From the beginning to the end of my inquiry, your advice was very helpful.

I also would like to express my gratitude to the study participants who enthusiastically engaged with my work and offered valuable insights into the dynamics of DNS abuse.

I must express my sincere gratitude to my family for their unwavering support and unceasing encouragement during my years of education, as well as during the process of conducting research and composing this project. Without them, this achievement would not have been feasible. I am grateful to my parents for their guidance and experience.

I want to take this time to show my sincere thanks to friends and college friends who have made good company, understanding the times of stress and relief during our college years. Their presence and support have been a great joy and motivation.

Finally, I would like to thank Trinity College Dublin and my lecturers for giving me opportunities over the past four years.
I am appreciative of what they have offered.
