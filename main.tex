\chapter*{Abstract}

This research project explores the vital subject of DNS (Domain Name System) abuse, which is widespread and jeopardises the reliability and security of the Internet. The integrity of DNS operations has become critical due to the growing reliance on the internet for both personal and professional activity. To promote a safer online environment, this project aims to increase transparency within the DNS ecosystem by examining the forms, effects and current mitigating techniques of DNS abuse. DNS abuse poses serious threats to internet security and includes phishing, confusable domains (typosquatting), domain hijacking, botnets, quick flux hosting, and domain generation algorithms (DGA). Every type of abuse puts users at risk by making identity theft, money loss, data breaches, and system intrusions easier, as well as by undermining confidence in online services. The reseach project emphasises how urgent it is to address these problems because new technologies like IoT, cloud computing, and AI have the potential to make them worse.

The methodology used in this study included a thorough examination of the DNS ecosystem, vulnerability identification, and an assessment of the mitigation initiatives that are currently being undertaken by important parties, such as registries and registrars. Surveying DNS infrastructure providers and stakeholders was a major part of the investigation to determine the existing level of transparency in the mitigation of DNS abuse. This involved assessing the usefulness of transparency reports and how well they work to stop DNS abuse.Key findings point to a serious weakness in DNS abuse mitigation initiatives' openness. Although several organisations have taken positive steps towards transparency, there is still a lack of standardisation and fragmentation in the industry as a whole. The report makes a number of suggestions to improve openness, such as creating uniform reporting guidelines, encouraging greater cooperation between DNS stakeholders, and implementing best practices to deal with DNS abuse in an open and transparent manner.

This research project adds to the current conversation on DNS abuse by providing a practical reform plan and a detailed grasp of its complexities. It establishes the foundation for more successful mitigation of DNS abuse by promoting greater transparency, which ultimately results in a more secure and reliable Internet.




\chapter*{Lay Abstract}

The goal of this project is to address DNS abuse to make the Internet safer. If you think of the Internet as a giant library, DNS is the index that lets you locate the specific book you are looking for. However, some people manipulate this index to point you to the incorrect book, one that could endanger you by installing malicious software on your computer, stealing your personal information, or stealing money without your knowledge. We refer to this type of deceit as DNS abuse, and it is a serious issue since it can cause people to lose faith in the internet. In this study, we examine how malicious actors use DNS to cause harm, how it affects regular internet users like you and me, and the measures taken to prevent them. We took particular note of the transparency and candour with which the Internet's operators handled these issues. We can all trust the Internet better if they are transparent about how they solve these problems. 

To gain an understanding of this, we reviewed publications on countermeasures against DNS abuse and spoke with numerous individuals involved in the Internet's index system. We found that there is still a great deal of room for improvement, despite the fact that some people are making an effort to be more transparent about how they are solving the issue. There is no standard approach to solving or discussing the issue, and nobody is in agreement. Our findings imply that, in order for everyone to collaborate more successfully, we need to improve the system. To ensure that everyone is aware of the steps being taken to protect the internet, we should all be able to deal with DNS abuse in a uniform manner and have a conversation about it. Those who maintain the index system for the Internet may make it feel safer for all of us to use it by being more transparent.

This project clarifies the causes, consequences, and significance of communicating openly and clearly about mitigating DNS abuse. We want to contribute to the development of a safe and reliable online environment for all users by offering suggestions on how to improve.

\section*{\Huge\textcolor{tcd_blue}{Acknowledgements}}

In the name of God, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.

First, I would like to thank God. Everything I do is only done with his permission. I sincerely thank everyone who helped me along the way with this thesis. First, I express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Stephen Farrell, my supervisor, whose knowledge, compassion, and tolerance greatly enhanced my graduate experience. From the beginning to the end of my inquiry, your advice was very helpful.

I also would like to express my gratitude to the study participants who enthusiastically engaged with my work and offered valuable insights into the dynamics of DNS abuse.

I must express my sincere gratitude to my family for their unwavering support and unceasing encouragement during my years of education, as well as during the process of conducting research and composing this project. Without them, this achievement would not have been feasible. I am grateful to my parents for their guidance and experience.

Finally, I would like to thank Trinity College Dublin and my lecturers for giving me opportunities over the past four years.
I am appreciative of what they have offered.
