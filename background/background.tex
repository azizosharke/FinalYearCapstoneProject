\section{Understanding DNS and Its Vulnerabilities}

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial part of the infrastructure of the Internet, serving as the key that converts computer-understandable IP addresses into human-friendly domain names. Although the DNS plays a vital role in maintaining ongoing online activities, privacy and security problems still arise. The ScienceDirect paper "Domain Name System Security and Privacy: A Contemporary Survey" provides a thorough analysis of these concerns. This survey highlights the fundamental significance of the DNS while illuminating the weaknesses that malicious actors may take advantage of \cite*{sciencedirect2023dns}.

A variety of security threats exist, ranging from DNS infrastructure-targeting distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults to cache poisoning and hijacking. Each of these attacks has the potential to do significant harm, including interruptions in service and the promotion of theft and spying. Due to the standard DNS design's lack of encryption, users' query data is vulnerable to misuse and eavesdropping, raising serious privacy problems. Still, weaknesses do not mark the end of the story. In the same survey, new approaches to improving DNS security and privacy are examined. The use of DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions), which authenticates DNS data and guarantees its integrity while repelling some types of attack, is one example of these advances in cryptographic security measures. Moreover, privacy-enhancing technologies are being used to encrypt DNS queries, preventing eavesdropping and manipulation, such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT).

The environment of DNS threats and defences is always changing in sync with the internet. For systems to be robust and resilient, it is essential to understand these weaknesses and the continuous efforts being made to mitigate them. An in-depth discussion of DNS vulnerability details, the effects of these safety concerns, and creative solutions that aim to bring in a new era of DNS security and privacy will be provided in this section \cite{sciencedirect2023dns}.

\section{Current efforts and organisations combatting DNS Abuse}

Addressing DNS abuse is a complex challenge that requires coordinated efforts across various sectors of the Internet ecosystem. Foremost among the entities dedicated to this cause is the DNS Abuse Institute. Established with a focused mission, the DNS Abuse Institute aims to combat DNS abuse and ensure the safety and security of the domain name system. Their goal is to assist the internet community in identifying, reporting, and mitigating instances of DNS abuse, thereby fostering a safer online environment \cite{dnsabuseinstitute2023}. The institute emphasizes the development and support of initiatives that enhance the understanding and mitigation of DNS abuse. They introduce innovative solutions like the "Compass Dashboards," which provide essential data and insights to registries and registrars, aiding them in making informed decisions to combat abuse. Furthermore, the DNS Abuse Institute is committed to transparency and education. They regularly publish reports and bulletins, such as the "DNSAI 2022 Annual Report" and the "DNSAI Bulletin 2023 04; Account Take Overs," offering a detailed view of the state of DNS abuse and the steps being taken to address it \cite{dnsabuseinstitute2023} . These publications serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders looking to understand the landscape of DNS abuse and the collective efforts to mitigate it  \cite{dnsai2022report}.

In addition to the DNS Abuse Institute, organizations like the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) play a critical role in the global effort to monitor and reduce DNS abuse. ICANN's reports and initiatives provide insights and guidelines that shape policies and practices in the domain name industry. Their work involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including registries, registrars, and policy-making bodies, to develop and enforce standards that minimize DNS abuse while maintaining the openness and interoperability of the internet \cite{icann2022dnsabuse} . These organizations, along with numerous others involved in the fight against DNS abuse, contribute to a multi-faceted approach that includes policy development, technological innovation, and community engagement.\cite{dnsabuseinstitute2023} By highlighting the objectives, methods, and reports published by these entities  \cite{dnsai2022report}   , this section will provide a comprehensive view of the current efforts and organizations dedicated to combating DNS abuse, illustrating the collaborative nature of this ongoing battle \cite{icann2022dnsabuse} .

\section{DNS Privacy and Security Enhancements}

The digital world is changing, and so too is the need for enhanced privacy and security measures within the Domain Name System (DNS). Significant advancements have been made to protect users and their data, particularly through the implementation of DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH). These technologies represent a paradigm shift in DNS query encryption, aiming to address privacy concerns and secure communication between clients and servers. DNS over TLS (DoT) offers a way to encrypt DNS requests and answers, making it harder for bad actors to simply intercept or change the data. This technology is essential for protecting user privacy and stopping man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. In the same way, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) leverages the security features and broad acceptance of HTTPS to protect DNS requests within the HTTPS protocol, adding an extra degree of protection.

The paper "DNS Privacy in Practice and Preparation," focusing on how these technologies are being accepted and put into effect, provides an in-depth review of these developments. It emphasises how important DoT and DoH are to protecting DNS privacy and how key public DNS service providers are supporting these more and more. The implementation of DoT and DoH is not without difficulties, regardless of their advantages. Their effectiveness depends on factors like performance concerns and the requirement for extensive implementation across multiple platforms. The study also highlights how critical TCP Fast Open (TFO) is to lowering TCP-based DNS query latency, which is essential for balancing privacy and speed  \cite{acm2023dnsprivacy}  .

\section{Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices }

To address the broad nature of the threats, combating DNS abuse requires an integrated strategy that integrates multiple strategies and best practices. Setting up procedures for reporting and monitoring is one fundamental tactic. Automated systems have the capability to track domain name registration patterns that may indicate DNS abuse, and protocols for reporting questionable actions can help ensure prompt intervention \cite{icannndnssec} . In order to confirm security and make sure systems have not been compromised, regular audits of DNS setups and domain registrations are also necessary \cite{lucas2021tls} .

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monitoring and Reporting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Use automated systems to monitor the registration of domain names for patterns that may indicate DNS abuse \cite{icannndnssec}. Establish procedures for reporting activities to authorities or cybersecurity organizations \cite{lucas2021tls}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security Awareness Training}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Develop training programs for users and IT staff with a focus on recognizing phishing attempts, practicing browsing habits, and understanding DNS security.
    \end{itemize}

        \item Implementation: Deploy DNSSEC to ensure the integrity of DNS data. This involves signing DNS records to protect against modifications and DNS spoofing.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for domain registrars and interfaces used for managing DNS \cite{icannndnssec}. This adds a layer of security beyond passwords, helping prevent unauthorized domain transfers or alterations \cite{moghaddam2014ecco}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Blacklisting and Takedown Services}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Collaborate with cybersecurity firms to identify and blacklist domains engaged in malicious activities. Establish response teams dedicated to taking down domains involved in DNS abuse.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collaboration}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Foster collaboration among internet service providers (ISPs), domain registrars, governments, and cybersecurity organizations. Share intelligence and best practices to collectively enhance defense against DNS abuse \cite{skopik2017collaborative}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regular Audits}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Conduct security audits of domain registrations and DNS configurations to verify their security and ensure they have not been compromised \cite{coronado2014auditing}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation: Enhance the domain registration process by implementing validation procedures. This may involve verifying the identity of individuals or organizations registering domains, especially for domains that resemble brands or fall into sensitive categories. By taking these measures, we can strengthen security and mitigate risks associated with fraudulent domain registrations.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Each of these strategies plays a crucial role in creating a comprehensive defense against DNS abuse. By integrating these tactics, organizations can establish robust, proactive measures to detect, prevent, and mitigate the ever-evolving threats posed by DNS abuse.

\section{Summary and Synthesis}

This chapter has examined all aspects of DNS abuse,  the various forms, the serious harm it does, as well as potential future threats and new trends. To create efficient regulations and countermeasures, it is essential to comprehend the extent and consequences of DNS abuse. The conversation emphasised DNS's vital function in the digital ecosystem as well as its susceptibility to misuse.Significant progress towards resolving these issues has been made by organisations like the DNS Abuse Institute and ICANN, as well as developments in DNS privacy and security technologies like DoT and DoH. Yet as new technologies are incorporated into the equation and the threat environment changes in sophistication, it becomes more and more important to adopt alert, flexible, and cooperative strategies.  

A road map for preventing DNS abuse is provided by the mitigation techniques and best practices discussed in this chapter. Every tactic contributes to a defence mechanism, from advanced technology solutions and improved methods for validation to monitoring and reporting. It is impossible to overestimate the value of cooperation, regular checks, and the application of cutting-edge technologies in anticipating and stopping DNS abuse. After analysing the data, it is evident that a team effort is needed to comprehend, track, and mitigate DNS abuse. A complex strategy that integrates multiple techniques and encourages collaboration across industries is required instead of a single, insufficient strategy. Our approaches to preserving the integrity and security of the DNS and, consequently, the larger internet infrastructure, must adapt as the digital environment does.

By understanding the connections between different aspects of DNS abuse and reinforcing the collective effort required for effective mitigation, stakeholders can be better prepared to face the challenges ahead. This chapter sets the stage for further research and action, aiming to contribute to a safer, more secure digital world.

\section{Future Research and Development}

It is more important than ever to conduct ongoing study and development as we navigate the ever-changing arena of DNS abuse. Future work must concentrate on comprehending new threats and creating creative countermeasures. The following are some recommended areas for additional study and possible advancements in the fight against DNS abuse:

I will come back to this chapter after I am done with my thesis 

\chapter{State of the Art}

This Chapter explores the strategies being employed to mitigate DNS abuse as well as new developments in this field. It explores and evaluates the effectiveness and transparency of multiple mitigation techniques, including DNS filtering and threat intelligence in which information about cyber-attacks that experts organize and analyse. Additionally, the use of domain generating techniques and DoT and DoH are two novel forms of DNS abuse that are highlighted in this section. Along with the role of AI and machine learning in identifying and mitigating DNS abuse is covered. The final half of the section includes a discussion on potential future research areas and technologies to improve DNS abuse mitigation. Case studies offer practical insights into DNS abuse occurrences. 

\section{Current Strategies and Their Effectiveness in Relation to DNS Abuse}

DNS abuse presents a significant challenge for internet entities involved in domain name management. Various approaches are employed to mitigate such abuse, including DNS filtering, which regulates access to specific websites and prevents you from accessing malicious sites that can administer phishing and ransomware. Additionally, threat intelligence methodologies leverage data analysis to identify potential risks, as exemplified by \cite{schmid2021thirty}. Anomaly detection plays a role in identifying suspicious DNS activities indicative of malicious intent using Packet Analysis to analyze individual packets for DNS allowing for real-time detection and statistical analysis which involves performing statistical analysis on a large dataset of DNS traffic. However, these methods may encounter operational challenges, such as errors and the need for expedited access to critical threat data. 

\subsection{Mitigation Strategies}

Different methods are employed to mitigate DNS Abuse, including the implementation of tools for blocking, awareness of potential threats, and identification of anomalous behaviour. DNS filtering entails the regulation of website access based on predetermined rules, which can have varied outcomes depending on the context in which can happen in different environments such as register and registry in which it implements mechanisms to compare DNS names to the block list and given set of rules then take the necessary action such as homographs attacks in which DNS filtering mechanism play a role in mitigating them by comparing domain names against blocklists and predefined tule to identify potentially malicious homographs as stated earlier. Threat intelligence plays a role in identifying potential dangers and detecting unusual activities within the DNS, as noted \cite{rizvi2022application} such as enables the proactive identification and assessment of potential threats and malicious activities which includes detecting patterns indicative of phishing, domain hijacking, malware distribution and other forms of DNS abuse. Evaluating the effectiveness of these methods requires careful consideration of their performance in real-world scenarios. For instance, while DNS filtering can effectively block malicious content, it may inadvertently permit harmful elements to bypass the filtering process, potentially impacting user experience. Similarly, the efficacy of threat intelligence relies on the timeliness and accuracy of the data utilized. However, identifying anomalous behaviour poses challenges, as distinguishing between malicious actions and legitimate activities performed in innovative ways can be challenging.

\subsection{Evaluation of Transparency}

Demonstrating the mechanisms through which DNS abuse can be mitigated is great step in fostering trust among stakeholders, including internet users, businesses, and policymakers. Simplified and transparent approaches to DNS abuse mitigation underscore a commitment to accountability and collaborative efforts in addressing abuse. Transparency in the context of DNS abuse mitigation encompasses clear communication of preventative measures, disclosure of incidents, and accessibility of information regarding decision-making processes. According to \cite{chaganti2023survey}, organizations that are forthcoming about their objectives tend to engage in regular updates and dialogue with the community, contributing to the clarity and integrity of the DNS.

\section{Emerging Trends in DNS Abuse}

Advancements in the misuse of DNS are altering the landscape of online security, introducing novel challenges and vulnerabilities. Among these emerging threats, sophisticated techniques such as the utilization of DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) mechanisms have gained prominence. These protocols aim to enhance privacy and security by encrypting DNS queries, but simultaneously, they offer adversaries new avenues to obfuscate malicious traffic, complicating detection efforts. Furthermore, the proliferation of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) poses significant risks, as highlighted by \cite{kapoor2021ransomware}.  DGAs generate numerous seemingly random domain names, complicating the identification of potential threats. As the dynamics of the DNS infrastructure evolve, it is imperative for cybersecurity professionals to remain abreast of these developments. Continuous refinement of strategies and proactive measures are essential to counteract the adaptive strategies employed in DNS misuse, thereby safeguarding the integrity and trustworthiness of internet systems.

\subsection{New Forms of DNS Abuse}

The field of cybersecurity is rapidly advancing, bringing forth new challenges as it evolves, and constantly moving the goalposts for defence mechanisms. The introduction of DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is akin to a double-edged sword. While these encryption protocols were designed to bolster privacy and security by encrypting DNS queries, they inadvertently provide attackers with means to disguise malicious traffic. This broadens the attack surface, affecting everything from individual consumer devices to extensive corporate networks. For instance, attackers could leverage DoT and DoH in enterprise settings to circumvent outdated security controls and establish hidden communication channels. Moreover, Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) play a significant role in the cyber threat landscape by automatically generating vast numbers of random domain names, making it exceedingly difficult to identify and shut down malicious sites. \cite{kaur2023artificial}. This tactic, integral to botnet command and control (C2) operations, significantly complicates the efforts of cybersecurity defences in threat prediction and mitigation.
The adoption of DoT and DoH offers several benefits, such as enhanced privacy by preventing the surveillance of DNS queries and improved security through the encryption of DNS traffic, which hampers hackers' attempts to intercept or manipulate data. However, these protocols also enable attackers to conceal their malicious activities, posing challenges for traditional DNS security systems in detecting and filtering out harmful content. Additionally, these protocols might bypass content filtering policies inadvertently, leading to potential security breaches within organizations.
Conversely, DGAs provide attackers with a method to evade detection and maintain C2 communications, as the dynamically generated domains are difficult to predict and pre-emptively block. This results in an overwhelming number of domain names for security mechanisms to monitor, complicating the threat intelligence process and necessitating continuous vigilance and blacklist updates. The widespread adoption of these technologies underscores the need for cybersecurity professionals to adopt a proactive and informed stance, understanding their potential for exploitation and developing comprehensive strategies. These strategies must strike a balance between the benefits of encryption and domain generation and the imperative to prevent DNS abuse, ensuring the integrity and security of the online environment.


\subsection{Predictive Measures and Their Transparency}

Efforts to mitigate DNS abuse are geared towards promptly halting such activities by utilizing complex systems and advanced machine learning algorithms to detect patterns indicative of abuse. Articulating and sharing insights about the decision-making processes in predictive modelling is deemed crucial. Such transparency aids in understanding the rationale behind predictions, mapping out the data used for model training, and clarifying the methods that guide decision-making, as highlighted by \cite{hussain2022software}. Striking a balance between the complexity of predictive models and their interpretability is a significant challenge. Therefore, it is essential to approach this challenge with caution, ensuring that the models are not only effective in identifying DNS abuse but also accessible for thorough examination and accountability.

\section{Technological Advancements}

Improvements in technology, especially using AI and machine learning to fight DNS abuse, are changing how things are done. AI and machine learning are very important in finding and stopping DNS misuse. These tools use automatic systems and good pattern understanding to quickly check large amounts of data \cite{goethals2021enabling}. This helps us spot even little bad habits, too. But, when AI and machine learning work together, it can be difficult to see how things work. Some complicated computer programs are like a mystery box, making people scared about how to understand them. People have to find a good balance between difficulty in identifying danger and clarity in being responsible.

\subsection{Role of AI and Machine Learning}

Fighting DNS abuse with AI and machine learning is important. It's a new way to find and stop dangers before they become a problem. These tools assist groups to examine large amounts of data quickly, discovering hidden patterns in the internet's domain name system that reveal bad behavior. AI's ability to learn from past data lets it see changing attack methods. This helps to find threats easier \cite{tariq2023critical}. Machine learning models, which can change, help us find issues early and respond fast. This makes the whole DNS system stronger. Even though they give hope, there are still obstacles that make things hard to understand clearly. This needs a careful balance between how hard things are and who can be held accountable.

\subsection{DNS Abuse Transparency Challenges with AI and Machine Learning}

AI and machine learning can help make DNS abuse prevention better, but experts need to fix issues by being clear. People are worried about understanding why complex systems make choices because of the "black box" part. It is important to understand how AI models make certain decisions. This helps build trust and makes sure people are responsible for them. There are difficulties in making things clear, such as needing to write down what data was used for training, telling others about the things that affect choices, and explaining how models change to face new risks. It's still hard to find the right balance between the complexity needed for good threat detection and the openness needed for blame.

\section{Case Studies and Real-World Applications}

In the past few years, technology has become so widespread that we have witnessed an unmatched number and complexity of cyber threats. A significant vulnerability that can be exploited is the Domain Name System DNS, a critical part of internet infrastructure that translates human-readable names into IP addresses \cite{kumari2021sac115}. In this case, the study completely analyze one specific company, XYZ Corporation, as an example of DNS abuse in the real-world environment and analyze all details through figures, graphs, and charts. This abuse of DNS took place as a prolonged campaign against XYZ Corporation, a multinational technology conglomerate \cite{mohammed2021network}. Attackers used weaknesses in the company's DNS infrastructure to perform various malicious activities, including domain hijacking, DNS tunneling, and DDoS attacks. A timeline graph was also prepared to see the scale of abuse and how the attacks progressed with each event that occurred in the organization as shown in Figure \ref{fig:figureOne}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{background/XYZ1.png}
\caption{Timeline of DNS Abuse Attacks on XYZ Corporation}
\label{fig:figureOne}
\end{figure}

The relationship between this correlation raises questions about the attackers' understanding of the inner workings of the firm, as well as insider threats. A closer analysis of the DNS abuse types employed by such offenders revealed that domain hijacking was common \cite{bayer2022study}. Figure \ref{fig:figureTwo} shows how diverse DNS abuse techniques were used in the XYZ Corporation case, and domain hijacking was significantly higher than all other methods combined.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{background/XYZ2.png}
\caption{Distribution of DNS Abuse Techniques Against XYZ Corporation}
\label{fig:figureTwo}
\end{figure}

There is a domain hijacking technique where the attackers may effectively take control over a company without authorization; domain hijacking is one of the major threats to the organizations that are affected. The figure shows that strong Security is key to preventing unauthorized access to domain registration accounts; favoring multi-factor authentication is the way of keeping these attacks away \cite{paz2020cyber}. This case study sheds light on the subtleties of DNS abuse as it targeted XYZ Corporation, showing the importance of understanding and dealing with an unpredictable cyber threat environment. The figures, graphs, and charts serve to illustrate the attack procedures for safeguards and give credence to the notion that an all-encompassing cybersecurity strategy is integral to preventing DNS abuse in the networked digital environment of our day.

\section{Challenges and Future Directions}

When dealing with issues about DNS misuse, big issues are quick changes in new threats, the need for global teamwork right away, and the constant use of technology. Fixing the balance between lies and truth, getting better at recognizing threats, and overcoming old tech limits remain very hard tasks. In the future, scientists should try to make technology better \cite{pour2023comprehensive}. This means making AI models better at understanding what's happening in DNS traffic. This also means finding ways to use blockchains for better protection when registering domains. Concentrating on using local tools could offer new methods to safeguard the DNS system. Key persons, quick shifts to new threats, and discovering new answers will be very important in deciding how to manage DNS abuse in the future.


\subsection{Identification of Current Challenges}

It's really important to find ways to stop misuse of DNS. This will aid in crafting clever responses and improve things continually. A big problem is handling threats that change and adapt over time. As naughty people on the internet change how they fool others, we need to change how people stop the wrong use of DNS \cite{bhattacharya2023dns}. This will require constant effort to make new plans and update old ones. One big issue in working together globally is making contact with people from all over the world. The internet works everywhere, and misusing DNS is a problem everywhere in the world. Experts have to join forces to fix this issue \cite{altulaihan2022cybersecurity}. Putting together many rules and laws and ways to follow them is a tough task. It needs careful thinking and teamwork. A big issue is an ongoing struggle to find a balance between reducing wrong positive and negative outcomes. People need easy methods to stop bad things on the internet while also not interrupting good internetwork. Fixing this careful balance is still a major issue. Big plans can spoil user experiences \cite{lyu2022survey}. But, if something is too simple, bad behavior might not be seen. As DNS misuse changes, we have to solve these issues. This will improve and make our methods against it better and stronger.

\subsection{Discussion on Future Research Directions and Technologies}

When planning to stop the misuse of DNS in the future, discussing new research ideas and upcoming technology is crucial. The always-changing state of internet threats needs us to continually create new things. This is so people can stay one step ahead of the bad people. Future work on DNS abuse needs to start by building better tools. These can help tackle how bad guys on the internet keep changing their tricks \cite{bovenzi2023blockchain}. This means we need to look at more complex AI and machine learning tools that can understand the details of web traffic. This will make the results more accurate and stop wrong signals from being sent. Moreover, there is a rising need to use blockchain tech to make domain registration safer and stop any bad or harmful changes. People should have easy methods to report bad use of DNS. This will make sure everyone knows about dangers and how to fix them easily \cite{gu2021iot}. Working together in the world is very important because computer dangers go beyond borders. So, everyone around the world needs to work together. The discussion about where research needs to go in the future highlights the importance of working together. The DNS system should have better technology, work as a team, and have agreed-upon methods to make it strong against smart ways of misuse.


\section{Conclusion}

The wrong use of DNS keeps being a big issue. Present plans, while sometimes useful, require constant adjustment and getting better. It's key to have solutions for fixing issues available. This helps build trust and work well with those involved. Abusing DNS in new ways brings fresh issues that require clever solutions. AI and machine learning can help find things, but we need to show how they work better so people can keep bad people in check. Learning from real-life situations teaches us a lot about good and bad ways of being open. This helps us create the best methods for our business. There are still issues with showing and stopping the wrong use of DNS. People need to keep learning and working as a team. People should focus on making better technology, joining forces with other nations, and using common methods of sharing information in the future. As the internet changes, we must stay active and work together to stay ahead of bad people who want to hurt us. This will make sure that the DNS is secure.

\section{Summary of Findings}

The study about the bad use of DNS looked at current ways, checked new trends, talked about tech advancements, and explored real examples in life. Checking for secret ways in plans to stop DNS abuse showed the value of clear communication and honesty in building trust with the community. People are finding new ways to misuse the DNS system and guess it. People have to keep making new things, so they don't get caught by changing dangers. Improvements in technology, especially with AI and learning machines, showed how automation can make it easier to spot dangers. But it also made things harder to understand, and this needs careful looking at. Examples from real life showed what did and did not work in making DNS abuse clearer. These provided essential advice for the business. Issues with making things clear and stopping wrong actions were found. This shows how much it matters to keep learning and working with others. In the future, discussing issues and future plans will show the need for creative studies, help from other nations, and common ways to share information. The approach in this paper that stresses action and working together is really important to handle the changing pattern of DNS abuse. It's also important to keep the DNS system safe and secure.



























\section{Figures}
Graphs, pictures and other images should be included in your report as a numbered, captioned figure. An example is given in Figure \ref{veldis}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
      \includegraphics{background/5e1-1.pdf}
      \caption{Velocity distribution on the mid-plane for an inlet velocity for case 1.}
      \label{veldis}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The figure and caption should be centred. The figure numbering starts at 1 at the beginning of each chapter. The caption should provide a brief description of what is being shown. The figure should appear in the document after it is referred to in the text. No figure should be included which is not referred to in the text. Ensure that the size and resolution of images imported from software are sufficient to read any text.

\section{Tables}
Tables are an important way of displaying your results. Table \ref{tab:treatments} is a sample table, adapted from the Master/Doctoral Thesis template at \url{http://www.latextemplates.com/cat/theses}, which was generated with this code:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[b]
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\toprule
\textbf{Groups} & \textbf{Treatment X} & \textbf{Treatment Y} \\\midrule
1 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.7\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\
4 & 0.68 & 0.3\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{table}[b]
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\toprule
\textbf{Groups} & \textbf{Treatment X} & \textbf{Treatment Y} \\
\midrule
1 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.7\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\
4 & 0.68 & 0.3\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Tables are numbered in the same way as figures. Typically tables also have a short caption, but this is not universally true. The number and caption appear above the table, not below as with figures. Again, no table should appear in the report which has not been referred to in the text. Tables should come after they are discussed in the text. The exact formatting of the table depends somewhat on the content of the table, but in general, the text in the table should be the same font and size as the main text. 

\section{Equations}
All equations should be numbered sequentially. The numbering restarts automatically at the beginning of each chapter, and contains the number of the chapter alongside the equation number. Unlike figures and tables, you may not need to refer to every equation in the text. You should take care to format equations properly. Do no simply try to use plain text. Use the equation layout facilities. An example of how equations should appear is shown in \eqref{sampleequation}. Here is the code for it:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\textrm{div}(\underline{u}) = \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \frac{\delta v}{\delta y} +
        \frac{\delta w}{\delta z} = 0
\label{sampleequation}
\end{equation} 
\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{equation}
\textrm{div}(\underline{u}) = \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \frac{\delta v}{\delta y} + \frac{\delta w}{\delta z} = 0
\label{sampleequation}
\end{equation} 

\section{Referencing published work}
It is important to give appropriate credit to other people for the work that they have shared through publications. In fact, you must sign a declaration in your report stating that you understand the nature of plagiarism. As well as avoiding plagiarism, citing results or data from the literature can strengthen your argument, provide a favourable comparison for your results, or even demonstrate how superior your work is.

There are many styles to reference published work. For example, the parenthetical style (which is also called the \emph{Harvard style}) uses the author and date of publication (e.g. ``Smith and Jones, 2001''). There is also the Vancouver style (or the \emph{citation sequence style}). In the IEEE style, which is used in this document in the default setup, the publications are cited using bracketed numbers which refer to the list in the References section at the end of the report. The references are listed in the order that they are cited in the report. A variant is \emph{name sequence style}, in which the publications are referenced by number, but the list is arranged alphabetically. The following paragraph shows the use of the IEEE style: 

\begin{quote}
Several studies have examined the sound field around tandem cylinders generated by flow\cite{fitzpatrick2003flow,finnegan2010experimental}, while other investigations have focused on the effect of an applied sound field on the flow\cite{hall2003vortex}. Papers from conference proceedings\cite{jordan2001array}, books\cite{paidoussis2010fluid} and technical reports\cite{reyes2007power} can be dealt with in the same style.
\end{quote}

The IEEE style has the advantage that it is a little more compact in the text and does not distract from the flow of the sentence if there are a lot of citations. However, it has the disadvantage that it is not immediately clear to the reader what particular work has been referenced. You can use author names directly and discuss the work of Finnegan et al. \cite{finnegan2010experimental} similar to this sentence to make it more readable. 

It actually does not matter which particular referencing style is used as long as three important considerations are observed:
\begin{itemize}
\item the referencing style used throughout the document is consistent;
\item all material used or discussed in the text is properly cited;
\item nothing is included in the reference list that has not been cited.
\end{itemize}

Check with your supervisor as they may have a strong opinion on what you should use

This template has a suitable referencing style already set up -- you should use it and use the built-in BibTeX system to manage your references. See above for examples of how to cite a reference and look in the \texttt{sample.bib} file to see BibTeX references. It is strongly recommended that you use a bibliographic tool, such as EndNote (check out https://www.tcd.ie/library/support/endnote/), as this will facilitate compliance with these three requirements. Endnote can help you build you .bib file. Remember \href{http://scholar.google.com}{Google Scholar} and other search engines will give you BibTeX references for lots of academic publications. Be aware that Web of Science is more reliable for giving the full record for the BibTeX entry. Otherwise, you can easily make up your own based on the examples in that file.
