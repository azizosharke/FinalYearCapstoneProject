\chapter{Appendix}
The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a role, in the infrastructure of the internet by converting user domain names into IP addresses. However due to its use and importance it has become a target for actors seeking to exploit it. These abuses range from setting up phishing websites to taking advantage of DNS for activities like typosquatting. The responsibility for mitigating abuse primarily lies with DNS infrastructure providers, such as registrars and registries. These entities respond to reports of abuse by taking down confirmed domain names or proactively blocking the registration of harmful ones. While these actions are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of DNS they also raise questions about how transparent these measures 

Transparency in the context of mitigating DNS abuse refers to the disclosure of actions taken by registries and registrars including the criteria and reasoning behind their decisions. Currently there is prevalence in publishing transparency reports related to this matter leading to a lack of clarity and understanding, about the processes involved in combating DNS abuse. This project aims to address this issue through a survey involving registries registrars and other stakeholders actively engaged in mitigating DNS abuse.

The main objective of the survey is to collect organize and describe the transparency reports they're presently accessible. This will help us gain an understanding of the status of transparency, in mitigating DNS abuse.
