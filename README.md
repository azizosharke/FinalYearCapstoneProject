## DNS Abuse Transparency - Final Year Capstone Project

This research project explores the subject of DNS (Domain Name System) abuse, which
is widespread and jeopardises the reliability and security of the Internet. The integrity of
DNS operations has always been critical due to the growing reliance on the Internet for
both personal and professional activity. To promote a safer online environment, this project
investigates whether and if so, additional transparency related to DNS abuse mitigations might
help improve the overall DNS ecosystem. Every type of abuse puts users at risk by making
identity theft, money loss, data breaches, and system intrusions easier, as well as undermining
confidence in online services. The research project emphasises how urgent it is to address
these problems because new technologies such as IoT and AI have the potential to worsen
them.
The methodology used in this study included a thorough examination of the DNS ecosystem,
vulnerability identification, and an assessment of mitigation initiatives that are currently
being implemented by important parties, such as registries and registrars. The survey of
DNS infrastructure providers and stakeholders was part of the selective survey to determine
the existing level of transparency in the mitigation of DNS abuse. This involved assessing
the usefulness of transparency reports and how well they work to stop DNS abuse. Key
findings point to a serious weakness in the openness of DNS abuse mitigation initiatives.
Although several organisations have taken positive steps toward transparency, there is still
a lack of standardisation and fragmentation in the industry as a whole. The report makes
several suggestions to improve openness and transparency, such as creating uniform reporting
guidelines, encouraging greater cooperation between DNS stakeholders, and implementing
best practices to deal with DNS abuse openly and transparently.
This research project adds to the current conversation on DNS abuse by providing a practical
reform plan and a detailed grasp of its complexities. It establishes the foundation for more
successful mitigation of DNS abuse by promoting transparency, which we hope will result in
a more secure and reliable Internet.
