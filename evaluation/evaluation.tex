\chapter{Evaluation \& Discussion}

In this chapter, I will focus on evaluating and discussing two forms of DNS abuse, which are confusable domains and phishing due to their popularity among bad actors by testing and validating them. I will dive into real-life examples to illustrate the severity of these threats and examine existing mitigations and techniques used to mitigate them to test how well my project met the objectives. Additionally, I will propose to improve transparency around these mitigation strategies to foster accountability and trust. Through analysis, I will assess the feasibility of implementing such transparency measures by performing an analysis using data and evidence. Finally, I will address the limitations of my work. This comprehensive approach aims to provide information on how to effectively address DNS abuse while promoting transparency in the process. 


\section{Confusable Domains}
\subsection{Identification \& Examples of Targeted Domains}

The choice of such domains to target and outsource depends on many factors, each with its implications on business strategy, marketing, and law enforcement. The selection of these domains hence matters a lot in creating potential conflict, especially those related to existing trademarks. Understanding these selection criteria is very important in trying to negotiate the hurdles of the digital market and in protecting rights through intellectual property. To navigate these complexities effectively, it is essential to consider several key factors. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Commercial Appeal:} The domains with commercial appeal attract traffic and can generate income. They are short and memorable and relate to popular products or services, sometimes leading to ownership arguments \cite{Li2002ConflictDomainTrademark}.
  
  \item \textbf{Keyword Relevance:} Similarly, a domain specific to keywords ranks well in the search and indirectly lures organic traffic, which will help enormously the business in the search for common search queries and, in this process, generates more clicks.
  
  \item \textbf{Similarity to Well-known Trademarks:} Domain names, when similar to those of famous trademarks, can cause legal trouble for the trademark owner. laws prevent confusion and protect the brand reputation in disputes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-life examples}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cybersquatting :} registering domain names that closely resemble trademarks or brands and selling them at exorbitant prices; this also includes advertising to earn money, collecting email, or even jumping to evil websites. One such renowned case was that of Amul, a major dairy company in India, during 2019-2020. Amul had an impersonation case of similar domain registration for purposes of phishing, which lured people into fraudulent schemes like fake distributorship or job opportunities. In the last three years, from 2018 to 2020, this issue forced Amul to issue public notices and take legal action against such misuse of their brand in domain names, impressing the magnitude of legal recourse and awareness of brand protection in its readers \cite{MehtaCybersquatting}.
    
    \item \textbf{Typosquatting- URL hijacking :} This involves registering domain typographical errors for well-known domains so that the traffic from users making URL entry mistakes goes to them. For example, "goggle.com" replaces "google.com," which leads to a site with an abundance of pop-ups and ads, most likely leading to malware infections from phishing or other malicious activity emanating from exploiting these errors \cite{SplunkTyposquatting}. One of the US healthcare providers, Elara Caring, gives an illustrative example of a cyberattack it encountered in December 2020: as a result, the following breaches in healthcare cybersecurity were defined: unauthorised access to email accounts of staff members. The breach, which lasted for a week, underscores the need for an improved incident response \cite{PandaSecurityPhishing}.
    
     \item \textbf{Reverse Domain Name Hijacking  :} is the act of trademark owners trying to take a domain away from its rightful holder based on the claim of trademark rights, considering that he holds a bona fide registration over the said domain. It may also be described as the use of legal or dispute resolution mechanisms to try to force people from their domains \cite{Sun2006DomainTrademarkConflict}.  An RDNH was claimed in a UDRP action against "groovle.com," in which the domain was purported to be too close to Google's trademark. However, since the domain was used for another search engine, it was deemed legitimately used and did not violate Google's trademark or be registered in bad faith \cite{Singh2011ReverseDomainHijacking}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection {Homograph attacks} 


The risk of continued homograph attacks is in using characters that look similar and thus mimic trusted domain names, such as using a lowercase "l" (el) to look like an uppercase "I" (eye) in the name "paypal.com" vs. "paypaI.com". The introduction of International Domain Names has only expanded the scope of such attacks, yet their prevalence is less. Still, the growing trend of more and more phishing attacks and how easy it is to fool users by taking them to fake sites require eternal vigilance. As a result of a new study, "Cutting through the confusion" \cite{holgers2006homograph}, it is going to reveal the scale and potential threat to homograph attacks, such as visual similarity between characters from different scripts, like Cyrillic or Greek, which is displayed in punycode in browsers, when attackers register domains that are visually similar to legitimate ones. This can be summarised in the table below, showing possible and actual registrations of such deceptive domains; hence, bringing out the difference between potential and actual use of the deceptive domain. For example, the domain "yahoo.com" had more than 5000 potential homograph variants, with only two actually registered, and "google.com" had a thousand possibilities, with four actual registrations.This is indicative of the importance of developing early preventive development and raising awareness of the risk from homograph attacks, as it sets into a very necessary chain of understanding mechanics and scope of homographs prevalence.

This table will be added in order to clearly show, by means of a graphic illustration, the scope and scale of homograph attacks, which point to the potential risks that these attacks could pose to online security and the awareness and mitigation strategies that need to be put in place for protecting internet users from such deceptive practices. Its noteworthy contribution will be added to the body of knowledge about how homograph attacks are leveraged and their prevalence across various high profile domains.

\end{figure}

\subsection{ Real-life Mitigations}

The following scenarios are examples of real-life confusable domain mitigations :

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cloudflare's Zero Trust Services Approach :} The Cloudflare Zero Trust Services stops the domain used to mimic the real domain by equipping businesses with anti-phishing protection through Cloudflare Gateway. This protects corporate networks from phishing, using the trust element of well-known brands \cite{Cloudflare2023}. This is initiated in the system when making the very first query to any domain through a DNS resolver of 1.1.1.1, which in turn initiates a fuzzy matching protocol for analysis and comparison with a database of potential phishing domains. This should issue alerts on domains that are similar to those of legitimate brands, hence easily detecting them promptly and for quick response. Cloudflare enables monitoring 24/7 in real time with historical analysis, offering security teams the alert of domain matching certain patterns, hence being suspected, for fast review and action if the domain has shown up within 30 days. Cloudflare further supports with criteria to specify the corresponding investigation in .json, based on given domains or patterns, and may be subject to security risks.

     \item \textbf{IDN Handling of Google Chrome : }Google Chrome enforces an IDN (Internationalised Domain Names) policy to determine in which Unicode or punycode form a domain label should be displayed. The domain label is tested to determine whether it has mixed script, invisible characters, or visually confusable characters, and whether it is actually validly converted to Unicode. For instance, domains containing characters of different scripts, or those that are clearly identified as mixed script confusables, will be displayed in punycode, warning the users of potential deceptions. Chrome also offers comprehensive warnings for secure URLs that appear to be an imitation of already known Web pages \cite{ChromiumIDN}.
     
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Techniques for Mitigating Confusable Domains}

Mitigating confusable domains requires sophisticated techniques tailored to address the unique challenges presented by both non-Internationalised Domain Names (non-IDNs) and Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs). This differentiation is significant due to the distinct nature of the threats they pose and the technical feasibility of the mitigation strategies applicable to each. The following is a detailed examination of mitigation techniques, along with discussions of the operational feasibility and potential collaboration frameworks involved.

Non-IDNs Mitigation Techniques : Strategies focus on identifying and mitigating domain squatting and typo-squatting, where attackers register domains that are typographical errors or close variants of legitimate domains to deceive users.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Registry-Level Measures: Domain registries can implement checks to prevent the registration of domains similar to existing trademarks or brand names, using algorithms to detect variations and misspellings closely similar to protected names \cite{WTR2020}.
  \item Trademark Protection Programmes: Services such as the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH) offer mechanisms for trademark owners to protect their rights by receiving notifications when someone attempts to register a domain that matches their trademark \cite{ICANNTMCH}.
  \item Automated Monitoring and Reporting: Automated systems can continuously monitor domain registrations for names that closely resemble known trademarks or brand names, allowing rapid detection and legal action against infringers \cite{TMCH2023}.
\end{enumerate}

IDNs Mitigation Techniques: The challenge with IDNs lies in the potential for homograph attacks, where attackers use characters from different scripts that appear visually like characters in the Latin script to create deceptive domains.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Punycode Awareness and Monitoring: Web browsers and security tools convert IDNs to punycode, a representation that encodes Unicode characters in ASCII. Awareness of punycode and monitoring for suspicious registrations can help identify potential homograph domains \cite{SOCRadar2023}.
  \item Browser-Level Defences: Modern web browsers have implemented defences against IDN homograph attacks by displaying the punycode version of the domain or alerting users when a domain name contains characters from multiple scripts \cite{Malwarebytes2017}.
  \item Collaborative Blacklisting and Sharing of Threat Intelligence: Organisations can collaborate to share information on known malicious IDNs, contributing to comprehensive blacklists that can be used by registrars, DNS providers, and end users to block access to malicious sites \cite{CyberThreatAlliance2023}.
  
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{ Transparency in Mitigation Efforts}

The element of transparency in dealing with confusable domains will be a great support in protecting the Internet from mischievous activities such as phishing and trademark infringements. This encompasses a set of practices by domain registries and registrars to identify and publicise those domains that could mislead due to their similarity to legitimate ones. It contains means of transparency, such as publishing lists of those domains to alert the community about possible threats and taking secure measures, if possible.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cloudflare's Zero Trust Services Approach: }Cloudflare's process for identifying and blocking confusable domains should be transparent to its users. This includes detailing the criteria for flagging domains as phishing sites and the mechanisms in place for users to appeal or request a review of blocked domains. By openly sharing the methodology behind their zero-trust rules and how they are applied through the Cloudflare Gateway, trust in Cloudflare's protective measures is bolstered among corporate networks.
  
  
  \item \textbf{IDN Handling of Google Chrome:} Transparency from the side of Google Chrome for the display of domain names helps the user understand the risks to his security. How policy could be properly executed, reported, or suggested for changes by the community of users to increase internet safety will also be explained.

  \item \textbf{Typo-squatting Detection Tools: }The similar methodology should be evident in how similar domain names are detected by tools such as DNStwist or URLCrazy and how it could be detected and shared in a proactive security setup, which could also help others in any organisation.
  
  \item \textbf{Collaborative Efforts and Intelligence Sharing: }The partnership between cybersecurity entities and domain registrars, as well as initiatives such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), should prioritise transparency in their operations. This includes the sharing of methodologies for threat detection, the criteria for taking action against malicious domains, and the processes for stakeholders to contribute or access shared intelligence. Transparency in these collaborative efforts ensures that actions taken against confusable domains are fair, understood by all parties involved, and supported by a broad community of internet security stakeholders.
  
 \item \textbf{Transparency for non-IDN registries : } 

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Registry-Level Measures: Transparency in level-registry measures becomes a necessity if trust has to be kept between registrants and domain trademark owners. They are published criteria and algorithms used to find variations and misspellings of names submitted for protection. Making these publicly available can then ensure fairness, and feedback in detecting mechanisms is therefore paved for improving them.
  \item Trademark Protection Programmes: Communication is openly clear about all operations; this includes verification and notification. The guidelines make it easier to understand the rights and measures to protect your brand.
  \item Automated Monitoring and Reporting: set by the criteria and thresholds for informing the brand owners about the protection level for their trademark, and thereby will enable improved monitoring.
  
\end{enumerate}
 
 \item \textbf{Transparency for IDN registries  : } 

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Monitoring and Identifying Measures for Suspicious Punycode Registrations: All domain registrars and trademark owners, together with security professionals, must adhere to measures on suspicious punycode registrations. Publicising the details of activities carried out to monitor them propagates homographic threats through collective ideas, also in their identification and mitigation.
  
  \item Browser-Level Defences: Web browsers have an important role in the defence of homograph attacks. They have to explain clearly to the user their defence mechanisms, such as ways of displaying punycode domains and ways of raising warnings so that they can be understood and trusted.
  
  \item Collaborative Blacklisting and Shared Threat Intelligence: Threat intelligence should be collaborative, based on a set of criteria, to blacklist domains. Clear rules on how to submit, validate, and remove data can also enhance the fairness and trust in collaborative security efforts.
\end{enumerate}
  
  
\end{itemize}

In summary, transparency in all these mitigation techniques not only builds trust between users, developers, and organisations, but also enhances the collective ability to respond to and prevent threats posed by confusable domains.


\subsection{ Analysis : Feasibility \& Practical Challenges}

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Automated Monitoring and Reporting: Feasible; Technology exists to automate monitoring, even though the refinement of algorithms to decrease false positives and negatives from human review can probably not be undertaken with existing resources.
  \item  Punycode Registration Monitoring: Feasible; This option is feasible and will mainly require the use of existing technology and cooperation that could be initiated with little difficulty between relevant stakeholders.
  \item Blacklisting and Threat Intelligence Sharing: Moderately Feasible; Since agreement could be reached on shared platforms and protocols, but they imply strong cooperation and trust among such diverse entities, which is unlikely to be developed fast.
  \item Registry-Level Measures: Not Feasible; this would require very heavy coordination and agreement on standards across diverse jurisdictions and registries, very complex in nature and long drawn.
  \item Trademark Protection Programmes: Moderately Feasible; They are well-functioning processes under such adequate structures like TMCH and can be learnt while proceeding with experience, but likely to face legal and operational issues.
  \item  Browser-Level Defences: Not Feasible; While this is technically feasible, it seems rather infeasible soon that user practices will become uniform across all web browsers and that all users will be well trained in various security practices.
  \item Cloudflare's Zero Trust Services Approach: Feasible; since well-architected infrastructure and broad adoption have made Cloudflare zero-trust rules simple and effective to deploy, with a balance of security and operational efficiency without seismic root and branch changes.
  \item IDN Handling of Google Chrome and Browser-Level Defences: Feasible; Given that Chrome today has an enormous user base and that the groundwork for stopping homograph attacks already exists, it stands to reason that a solution is reasonably possible, meaning not too difficult, within a set timeline, and within the lifespan of any other typical software product.

  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Phishing}

\subsection{Real-life examples}

Phishing, a cybercrime in which targets are contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data, has become increasingly sophisticated. Two notable examples include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item InterMed and Spectrum Healthcare Partners fell for a major phishing attack on 44,000 patient data. The InterMed breach involved clinical information for 33,000 patients, specifically names, birthdates, insurance and some social security numbers, from 4 to 10 September. In another case, Central Maine Orthopaedics is reported to have breached 11,308 of their patient record files by unauthorised access to emails that contain personal and clinical details. It is such an incident that really makes it very paramount to strengthen email security and at the same time to provide professional training on data protection \cite{HIPAAJournal2020Phishing} .
    \item Google and Facebook were almost fooled by a group of phishers into a \$100 million sophisticated scam in which they were imitating legitimate invoices from the suppliers. The case is one among many that have caused the vulnerability of technology firms to social engineering and the need for reinforced security, employee training, and verification processes to combat ever evolving cyber threats \cite{CNBC2019Phishing}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Real-life Mitigations} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Employee Awareness \& Training :} Chelsea Technologies has pointed out the importance of training employees to look for spoofing and attachments that are partd of phishing methods. Training employees in the way phishers operate is of paramount importance to keeping sensitive information safe \cite{DigitalGuardianPhishingPrevention}.

     \item \textbf{Comprehensive Security Measures :} LaptopMD points out that the risk of ignorant searches requires the formulation of policies that make it difficult to land on some sites. In addition to this, the awareness of phisher techniques and browsing issues by employees will greatly save them from being caught in cases of phishing \cite{DigitalGuardianPhishingPrevention}.
     
     \item \textbf{Technological \& Human Factors :} Combining technology with awareness, SecureHIM advises that both should be combined by any organisation to include spam filters and two-factor authentications with the vigilance of employees to detect and eliminate the risks of phishing \cite{DigitalGuardianPhishingPrevention}.
     
     \item \textbf{Awareness against unsolicited emails :} The Centre for Democracy and Technology outlines the training that should be provided to avoid activities such as phishing, including the need not to respond to unsolicited emails even when suspecting anything fishy \cite{CDTPhishingMitigation}.
     
     
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Techniques for Mitigating Phishing}

Current phishing attack mitigation techniques focus mainly on preventing phishing
emails from reaching users' inboxes and discouraging users from accessing
phishing websites \cite{Suzuki2021Phishing}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Email filters: It uses algorithms that filter phishing emails, based on the reputation of the sender, the embedding of the link, and suspicious keywords, so that these emails cannot reach the inbox.
    \item Domain blocking: Take steps to block access from within an organisation's network to known phishing sites so that the organisation's users do not stumble on them accidentally.
    \item User Training: Train users on how to recognise signs from phishing emails and the risk associated with clicking on unknown links or sharing personal and sensitive information.
\end{enumerate}

The introduction of the Situational Crime Prevention Approach (SCP) \cite{Suzuki2021Phishing}, which is an idea to understand the detailed thinking process of the offender and the attributes in the environment that allow the attack. This approach seeks to deter potential attackers simply by raising the level of effort and risk involved in an attacker conducting a successful phishing attack with a concomitant reduction in the likely rewards. This method underscores the importance of understanding the criminal's perspective and creating a hostile environment for phishing activities through strategic preventive measures. This method involves these steps : 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Increasing the Effort for Attackers: Implement strong authentication methods and encryption to make it more challenging for phishers to access or spoof legitimate websites or email accounts.
    \item Clarifying User Responsibilities: Educating users about their role in maintaining cybersecurity, including recognising phishing attempts, and reporting them.
    \item Enhancing Detection Probability: Using advanced detection technologies and threat intelligence to identify and neutralise phishing threats promptly.
    \item Limiting Phishers' Access: Restrict the amount of publicly available information that could be used to create convincing phishing emails or impersonating individuals or organisations.
    \item Discouraging Future Attacks: Implementing punitive measures against identified attackers and sharing information on phishing campaigns with broader communities to prevent repeat offenders.
\end{enumerate}

This measure is designed not only to stop a phishing attack, but rather to create an environment that would lead to the cost-benefit ratio for phishing not so appealing to the attackers. In fact, comprehensive perspectives on addressing phish through the three methods above singularly go to dramatically lower the vulnerability of organisations and individual persons to such acts.

In addition, Phishlimiter \cite{Chin2018PhishLimiter} , which is a new phishing detection and mitigation approach using Software-Defined Networking where it first proposes a new technique for deep packet inspection (DPI) and then leverages it with software-defined networking (SDN) to identify phishing activities through email and web-based communication.This is how it works:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): Analyses the part of the network packet data beyond basic header information. It inspects the content of the packets for signatures and patterns associated with phishing.
    \item Store and Forward (SF) and Forward and Inspect (FI) modes: SF mode temporarily stores packets for thorough inspection before forwarding, while FI mode prioritises immediate forwarding with parallel inspection to reduce latency.
    \item Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A machine learning model that classifies network traffic to identify potential phishing activities by learning from known phishing signatures and behaviours.
    \item Dynamic adjustment of network flows: Upon detection of a threat, the system dynamically reroutes or restricts traffic to mitigate potential phishing attacks, adapting to new threats in real time.
    \item Minimal disruption to network services: Designed to ensure that the phishing mitigation process does not significantly impact network performance, ensuring smooth operation of network services even under threat detection and mitigation activities.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Transparency in Mitigation Efforts}

Transparency in cybersecurity, including phishing mitigation techniques, refers to how openly and clearly methods, policies, and procedures are communicated, understood, and accessible to all involved stakeholders, particularly employees. Here is how transparency can be applied to each of the mitigation techniques described:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Employee Awareness and Training :} 
    
    Communication: This will consist of clear informing the employees about the kind of threat and how it could mean for the organisation and their role in these defences.
    
Accessibility: Make people aware that the repository exists, or make the resources easily available for reference. This would include an intranet site or a repository where people could easily access the trends in phishing on the latest and how to respond.


     \item \textbf{Comprehensive Security Measures: }
     
     Policy Publishing: All available policies, especially those related to web browsing, email attachments, and the use of security tools, will be published openly to let employees know about them.
     

Changes and Updates: Introduce the workforce to changes relating to security measures and how such changes are beneficial and serve as a cover against new hazards.

     \item \textbf{Technological \& Human Factors: } 
     
     Tool Transparency: Clearly state the tool and the reason for its being in place for security (e.g., spam filters, two-factor authentication), and its work on subduing phishing. 
     
User Control and Visibility: Attempt to give users some form of control or visibility over the security tools through which their work could be affected. Feedback from a blocked phishing attempt could, for example, help to reinforce the training.

     \item \textbf{Awareness against unsolicited emails:  } 
     
     Open Communication on Threats: Constant updates on new phishing techniques and any other notable attacks are discussed among the industry to be updated.
     
Best practices: Develop best practices for easy identification and to be visible on how to catch and react to phishing attacks, with graphic examples or checklists.

\item \textbf{Email Filters:} 

The effectiveness of email filtering technology in mitigating phishing attempts is greatly enhanced by transparency in its operational parameters. This helps to make the user understand, starting from analysing the reputation of the sender to the various steps related to decision making of phishing keywords. Continuous improvement builds trust, and perhaps some community members might even wish to provide feedback on how to improve the performance of the filters or report inaccuracies to the filter system regarding combat against the threats of phishing.

\item \textbf{Domain Blocking:} 

Such measures may include transparency in the criteria of the blacklisting and regular updates in relation to the access to the known phishing sites inside the organisation's network. This implies also setting a clear means for reporting unlisted phishing sites and correcting false positives by stakeholders. Education for users and IT professionals about these measures fosters a culture of cybersecurity.

\item \textbf{Situational Crime Prevention Approach (SCP):}

The major advantage of the SCP approach is the clear disclosure of both the applied methodology and the results obtained. This is through the explanation of the analysis of the criminal's thought and environmental factors aiding phishing, whereby the stakeholders are enlightened and, therefore, they make efforts to reduce it. The paper discusses how increasing the effort and risk to the attacker, while lowering the rewards, deters crime. Talking with the community helps them continue to improve and adopt ways to make an organisation's security environment dynamic and evolving.

\item \textbf{Phishlimiter:}

 The phishing detection system, such as the DPI integrated with SDN, has the ability to make its operation transparent, may increase user confidence, and preserve system functionality. It could emphasise the reliability and credibility of such a system if the criteria and algorithms by which the system determines a potential phishing attack are clearly spelt out. User feedback, which is positive pushing forward when the system fails in an inaccuracy or missed phishing attempt, to refine. Share those metrics around effectiveness of the system, the number of detected and prevented attacks, to show value. This article looks at some of the challenges, future development, and open directions for work that establishes an effort from the community in the field of cybersecurity.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Analysis : Feasibility \& Practical Challenges }

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Employee Awareness and Training : Feasible; Regular training and simulation exercises can be implemented across organisations of any size with scalable online platforms, requiring minimal resources beyond the initial setup.
    \item Comprehensive Security Measures :Feasible; The deployment of web filters and secure browsing policies is technically straightforward with existing technology. The main effort lies in continuous update of policies and employee education.
    \item Technological and Human Factors: Feasible; The integration of spam filters, two-factor authentication, and secure browsing add-ons is readily achievable with current technology. The human element, continuous employee vigilance, enhances the effectiveness of these tools without significant additional costs.
    \item Awareness against unsolicited emails: Feasible; Establishing and communicating best practices for handling suspicious emails involves minimal costs and leverages existing communication channels within organisations.

     \item User Training: Feasible; The training of the user's awareness on phishing is practical and beneficial, as it allows giving room for the user to measure the feedback on the effectiveness of training and to give suggestions for improvements that can enhance programme accessibility and user participation.
     
     \item Situational Crime Prevention Approach (SCP): Feasible; sharing information that identifies how an offender behaves and the environment that helps him/her attack. Although presenting this success story is of great value, great care must be taken in the handling of the detailed analyses of criminal tactics to avoid misuse. Community feedback will allow for further development.
     
     \item Domain Blocking: Moderately Feasible; Updating blacklists and dealing with the false positives, which have to be dealt with. This is a mammoth task, especially for relatively smaller organisations with few resources at their disposal. The process demands balance in responding very accurately within a very short time, which can over-stretch resources.
     
    \item Email Filters: Not Feasible;  Describing the general criteria and algorithms for email filtering is possible, but full disclosure risks security by enabling attackers to circumvent these measures. Partial transparency can be achieved without compromising the integrity of the system.
    
   
    \item Phishlimiter: Not Feasible; The complexity and proprietary nature of technologies like DPI and SDN make full disclosure of Phishlimiter's operations impractical. Detailed investigation of operations could compromise security. Keeping up with evolving phishing tactics requires continuous updates, which may not always be promptly disclosed to avoid aiding adversaries.
    
\end{enumerate}


\section{Collaboration Among Registrars, Registries, and DNS Collaborators}

This collaboration should be achieved with the DNS registry, the registry, and the collaborators. In that way, they can boost common resources and intelligence that can guide in making the Internet more secure and resilient. This strictly falls within the remit of registries and registrars acting in collaboration to put in place such stringent registration policy with procedures for verification, checking against mimicking existing trademarks or even popular domain names. In this way, the collaboration can even manifest itself through the sharing of sensitive data with regard to domain abuse threats and trends. Databases and threat intelligence platforms are shared amongst stakeholders, allowing them to anticipate and avert most such perils well before they impact netizens. This collective effort will enable the formulation of standards by which to coordinate responses to confusable domain incident reports. Mitigating confusable domains and phishing requires that registrars, registries, and DNS collaborators work in a common effort. This is due to the increasing level of threats and the shared responsibility of all actors involved in the DNS ecosystem. \cite{Catania2022} To put this into perspective, here are some examples: 


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Recent changes in the contract from ICANN's contracted parties have imposed on registrars and registries new specifications to define DNS abuse, together with clear requirements for the actions to be taken by such parties immediately actionable evidence of abuse is received. This is a major step toward establishing more clarity on the roles that these different stakeholders can play in addressing the problem of DNS abuse and ensuring that there is a common approach to redress \cite{Weinstein2023}.
  \item The community itself has approved new obligations from ICANN contract parties to further mitigate DNS abuse, demonstrating the will of the community to come together to address DNS abuse issues \cite{ICANN2023}.
  \item Efforts like NetBeacon, with the support of the DNS Abuse Institute, are being rolled out to reduce friction in reporting and mitigating DNS abuse. This service solves the current complexities and quality standards associated with the reporting of DNS abuse, as it makes the work easier for the registrars, ultimately narrowing down their scope to the relevant and evidenced report, as well as it underlines the need for cooperation among registrars, registries, and other DNS stakeholders. This is what is capable of saving the Internet and, at the same time, protecting the credibility and confidence of DNS \cite{NetBeacon}.
  
\end{enumerate}

Real-life examples of entities seeking to block the resolution of DNS names used by bad actors for phishing and other malicious activities, especially in connection with public recursive DNS servers, frequently revolve around matters of control, filtering, or securing internet traffic with various kinds of motivation corresponding to such sectors. Some attempted these efforts at the government, corporate, and individual levels. As typical examples that pinpoint those instances, consider the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Governmental Efforts to Block DNS Resolutions : Governments may interfere directly with DNS operation to enforce some censorship or block access to particular types of content. For instance, China uses the Great Firewall for regulation of access to the World Wide Web within their territory, including doing some DNS mismanagement to block unwanted content \cite{XuAlbert2017MediaCensorship}.
    \item Corporate and ISP DNS Filtering : DNS filtering can be deployed by companies and even ISPs in a bid to achieve enhanced online security. For instance, Heimdal Security explicates how DNS filtering works as one of the measures to prevent their access to various harmful or inappropriate websites, since it first checks the requests for domains. If some are actually flagged, access is denied, hence maintaining both security and productivity within one's organisation. This approach is very effective for the prevention of phishing and malware attacks because it stops DNS requests towards malicious sites \cite{
HeimdalDNSSecurity2023}.
    \item Ad Block DNS Services : Cloudflare discusses how DNS filtering can be used to prevent access to malicious sites and also filter what is harmful or unfit for viewing. This is done at the DNS level to prevent these sites from loading on devices. Cloudflare uses its DNS to filter part of a more prominent access control policy, which is an effort to secure company data and govern what employees will see on the network they manage \cite{CloudflareDNSFiltering2023} .   
\end{enumerate}

 On the negative side, attackers are taking advantage of DNS blocking mechanisms to carry out DNS-based attacks. These include using DGAs (Domain Generation Algorithms) for malware communication, using FastFlux techniques for slip-streaming attacks, basically creating malicious newly registered domains (NRDs) that appear benign and legitimate to an outside observer, etc. All this makes it difficult to block bad content at the DNS level, which calls for quite sophisticated countermeasures.


\section{Benefits of Transparency }


Transparency has numerous advantages when it comes to handling confusable domains and mitigating phishing. First, it encourages domain registry owners and registrars to be more accountable to each other by motivating them to take an active role in the identification and removal of confusable domains and phishing websites. Second, openness discourages bad actors who might otherwise take advantage of the anonymity provided by a lack of public monitoring. Third, by making these lists available to the public, registries and registrars enable companies and trademark owners to promptly take precautionary measures to safeguard their brands, including acquiring domain names or pursuing legal action. Transparency also facilitates community-based mitigation initiatives, in which researchers studying cybersecurity and the broader community work together to detect and eliminate dangers.This coordinated effort not only tackles confusable domains, but also considerably impedes phishing attempts by revealing, and thus reducing, the strategies employed by bad actors. The effectiveness of these tactics is significantly increased by using the collective expertise and attention to detail of the cybersecurity community, resulting in a more secure online environment for all parties involved.


\section{Drawbacks and Security Concerns} 

The publication of confusable domain lists, while aimed at enhancing cybersecurity, carries certain drawbacks and security concerns, including implications for phishing attacks. A primary issue is that making such lists public might serve as a guide for bad actors, revealing potential phishing targets. This exposure could allow bad actors to improve their strategies, thus remaining a step ahead of countermeasures. Additionally, the risk of false positives where legitimate domains are marked as confusable poses significant challenges. For legitimate businesses and individuals, being mistakenly associated with phishing can lead to unnecessary scrutiny, legal complications, and damage to their reputation. Furthermore, the tension between transparency and security raises questions about the effectiveness of these disclosures in preventing attacks. While the goal of transparency is to proactively mitigate abuse, including phishing, the vast number of domain registrations and the evolving tactics of domain abuse may diminish the utility of such lists for end users and businesses, potentially limiting their ability to preemptively address phishing risks.



\section{Limitations of Research Conducted on DNS Abuse Transparency }

This section lists a number of significant limitations that were observed during the research. The limitations imposed have had an effect on the extent, complexity, and applicability of the results, indicating potential avenues for future investigation to improve the understanding and efficacy of DNS abuse mitigation measures.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Variability in reporting standards: A significant challenge encountered was the lack of uniform standards across DNS infrastructure providers, including registrars and registries, regarding the definition of abuse, the thresholds of action, and the manner in which these actions are reported. Such inconsistency has made efforts to collect and compare the data of different entities hard to piece together into one coherent picture for sensible enforcement of DNS abuse mitigation.This diversity highlights the need for standardised reporting standards by contributing to a fragmented view of abuse management procedures.

    \item Limited Availability of Data: The general lack of transparency reports that are available to the public. Many providers either don't release these reports at all or do so in a way that leaves out important information that has to be thoroughly examined. Due to the restricted breadth of research due to this data availability issue, there may be gaps in our understanding of the entire range of DNS abuse management strategies. One major obstacle to evaluating the efficacy and transparency of the abuse mitigation techniques used by various parties is the lack of data.

    \item Reluctance to Share Sensitive Information: Information provided by respondents about abuses and what they do to mitigate them. In general, concerns about privacy, security, and the potential of revealing vulnerabilities to bad actors contribute to this reluctance, which leads to Limiting the capacity of researchers to perform a comprehensive analysis of DNS abuse mitigation strategies.
    
    \item Dynamic Nature of DNS Abuse: The evolving tactics employed by those who abuse DNS are constantly changing, so results can be out of date very fast. It is more difficult to create best practices that are applicable and efficient over time due to this quick change. Because DNS abuse is dynamic, it requires ongoing research and strategy adaptation to stay ahead of new threats.

    \item Potential Bias in Self-Reported Data: Self-reporting in transparency reports can still bias the results. Organisations have a tendency to emphasise their achievements while downplaying their shortcomings or difficulties. Due to this biased reporting, opinions about how well DNS abuse is being controlled can be distorted, which could cause mitigation efforts to be overestimated.
    
    \item Complexity of Measuring Impact: The evaluation of the efficacy of DNS abuse mitigation techniques is hampered by the nature of the Internet ecosystem. The evaluation procedure is further complicated by the indirect relationship that exists between specific actions taken to combat DNS abuse and larger effects, making it challenging to gauge the effectiveness of these efforts.

    \item International and Jurisdictional Challenges: Due to the international scope of the Internet, different legal and regulatory frameworks in different jurisdictions have an impact on DNS abuse and how it is mitigated. These differences highlight the need for cross-border cooperation and harmonisation by adding complications to the implementation and evaluation of transparent practices on an international scale.

    \item Ethical and Privacy Considerations: Ethical issues related to data collection and analysis that may include sensitive or personally identifiable information must be addressed in research in this field. Respecting ethical and privacy standards is very important, but it can also restrict the available research approaches, further limiting the breadth and depth of the study.

    
  
\end{enumerate}

All of these limitations point to the complex difficulties in conducting thorough research on DNS Abuse Mitigation Transparency. Teamwork, creative thinking, and a commitment to improving research techniques and methods in this developing subject will be needed to address these problems.

\section{How well did the project meet the objectives?}

In evaluating the success and impact of the research project on DNS Abuse Transparency, a key question in assessing the achievements and influence of the study on DNS Abuse Transparency is addressed. To what extent did the project fulfil its original objectives? This section seeks to systematically evaluate the project's accomplishments in relation to its objectives, taking into account the intricate domain of DNS abuse and the difficulties associated with improving transparency and management procedures. A thorough review is provided by looking at stakeholder participation, the contribution to understanding DNS abuse, the objective achievement, and the practical consequences of the results. Shortcomings are acknowledged and recommendations for further research and development are made, recognising both the successes and the areas that still require improvement. This reflection not only demonstrates the progress gained but also the continuous path toward a DNS ecosystem that is more open, safe, and resistant to abuse.


\subsection{Objective Fulfilment}

The project's goal was to improve stakeholder awareness and transparency about DNS abuse management. Despite encountering obstacles including inconsistent reporting guidelines and restricted data access, the effort succeeded in bringing to light significant flaws in the methods used to mitigate and handle DNS abuse. It revealed the complexity and diversity of processes across various institutions, underscoring the urgent need for standardised reporting requirements.

\subsection{Impact on Understanding DNS Abuse}

Given the difficulties, the research project provided insightful information on the state of DNS abuse mitigation. It demonstrated how DNS abuse is dynamic and how quickly changing bad actor tactics require mitigation measures to be updated on a regular basis. The research highlighted gaps in current understanding and management methods by highlighting the lack of transparency reports and providers' reluctance to provide sensitive information. These discoveries can act as a starting point for future studies and the formulation of policies.

\subsection{Stakeholder Engagement}

It was essential to interact with stakeholders such as registries, policymakers, and DNS registrars. The project encouraged discussion of the need for increased sector and jurisdiction cooperation and transparency. On the other hand, it appears that there is room for improvement in the influence on stakeholder behaviours and policies, particularly in terms of encouraging more proactive engagement and teamwork in the fight against DNS abuse.

\subsection{Practical Implications}
The project's outcomes have beneficial consequences in improving the transparency of DNS abuse mitigation. If put into practice, suggestions for creating uniform reporting guidelines and improving data exchange procedures may result in more efficient and cohesive methods for mitigating DNS abuse. These recommendations provide practical next steps for stakeholders to better address the issues raised.

\subsection{Suggestions for Improvement}

Deeper insights may be obtained for next projects by focusing study questions on newly developed DNS abuse strategies and investigating more aspects of transparency. Improving the methods for engaging stakeholders, perhaps by creating more inclusive forums or working together on joint research projects, could increase the scope and quality of the information collected. Furthermore, promoting the idea of the project could lead to more noticeable changes in practice and policy.

\subsection{Future Vision}

This research project embarked on an extensive effort to clarify the complexity of the transparency of DNS abuse. Taking into account obstacles such as the dynamic nature of abuse methods and the availability of data, the effort achieved significant achievements in highlighting important areas for development and setting the stage for future breakthroughs. The initiative is an essential move toward a more transparent and uniform strategy to mitigating DNS abuse, acknowledging the contributions and the need for continued research and cooperation. To move forward, all parties involved must work together to accept the recommendations and create a more secure, safe online environment.
